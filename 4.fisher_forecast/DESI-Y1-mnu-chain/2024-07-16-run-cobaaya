[autoselect_covmat] No cached covmat database present, not usable or not up-to-date. Will be re-created and cached.
[autoselect_covmat] *WARNING* No covariance matrix found including at least one of the given parameters
[mcmc] Could not automatically find a good covmat. Will generate from parameter info (proposal and prior).
[mcmc] Covariance matrix not present. We will start learning the covariance of the proposal earlier: R-1 = 30 (would be 2 if all params loaded).
