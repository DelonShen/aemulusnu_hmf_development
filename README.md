To get started
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate massfunction
python -m ipykernel install --user --name massfunction --display-name "massfunction"
```
Also install CLASS


This is a very messy repository that contains all the numerical studies that went into buildling the [`aemulusnu_hmf`](https://github.com/DelonShen/aemulusnu_hmf) library which is described in [ [24XX.XXXXX]](TODO). If you have any questions or are looking for something specific, please feel free to get in contact at [delon@stanford.edu](mailto:delon@stanford.edu). 

For now I'll simply specify which files generate the figures in the text
- Figure 2: `2.fit_with_tinker_form/graph_fit_performance_tier2.ipynb`
- Figure 3: `3.fit_with_gp/graph_emu_vs_tinker_performance_tier2.ipynb`
- Figure 4 and 5: `5.error_uncertainty_model/fit_error_model_tier2.ipynb`
- Figure 6: `4.fisher_forecast/log_derivs.ipynb`
- Figure 7: `4.fisher_forecast/log_derivs_lowS8.ipynb`
- Figure 8: `2.fit_with_tinker_form/graph_fit_performance.ipynb`
- Figure 9: `3.fit_with_gp/graph_emu_vs_tinker_performance.ipynb`
